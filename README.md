## Honeycomb 13 Puzzle Algorithm
This project is an open-source implementation of the Honeycomb Puzzle Algorithm, designed to solve a challenging brain-teaser game.
### Background
This hexagonal chessboard game was purchased by my daughter. The objective is to perfectly fit 13 transparent acrylic pieces into the board. Due to the vast number of possible combinations, the game is extremely challenging. We attempted various methods to solve the puzzle but were unable to find a solution. As a result, I decided to write a program to explore all potential puzzle combinations.

Note: The version of the game we acquired differs by one piece from the version available online. I initially thought that this discrepancy might mean there was no correct solution due to the missing piece. However, after completing this program, I was surprised to discover hundreds of different solutions, which was quite a revelation.
### Algorithm Approach
1. **Overall Approach**: Drawing inspiration from the solution to the Eight Queens problem, the algorithm initializes the board and pieces, traverses all possibilities, and uses dynamic programming to eliminate impossible solutions.
2. **Solution Space Estimation**: Considering the various transformations of the pieces and the size of the board, the solution space is vast, necessitating efficient storage and search strategies.
3. **Memory Optimization**: Various strategies are employed to reduce memory usage, such as hash storage and early termination of fruitless search paths.
4. **Reducing Variations**: By analyzing the actual transformation possibilities of the pieces, the search space is reduced.
5. **Recursion Order**: Starting the traversal with the most difficult pieces to place helps in quickly converging the search space.
### Installation Guide
1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
2. Ensure your development environment meets the following requirements: 
   - Programming Language: [Python]
   - Required Dependencies: [turtle]
### Usage Instructions
1. Run the main program to initiate the puzzle-solving algorithm.
